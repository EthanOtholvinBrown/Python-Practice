2. The area of a rectangle is the rectangle’s length times its width. Design a program that asks for the length and width of two rectangles. The program should tell the user which rectangle has the greater area, or whether the areas are the same.
3. The Fast Freight Shipping Company charges the following rates:
Weight of Package
2 pounds or less = $1.1
Over 2 pounds but not more than 6 pounds = $2.2

6. Find the sum of the squares of the first 6 numbers
7. The user has to provide a rate of interest (r) in the interval [1,2.5] and the number of years (n) in the interval [10,15]. For a provided combination of r and n, find and display the present value for a range of future values from [$10000, $100000] in steps of $20,000.

PROJECT 3:

1. Find the sum of the squares of the first 6 numbers
2. The user has to provide a rate of interest (r) in the interval [1,2.5] and the number of years (n) in the interval [10,15]. For a provided combination of r and n, find and display the present value for a range of future values from [$10000, $100000] in steps of $20,000. The formula for present value is
3. Write a program that displays a table of Celsius temperatures 0 through 20 and their Fahrenheit equivalents. Use the following formula for the conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit:
4. Get a value of C from the user that is between 15 and 30. Prompt the user until he/she enters the value in this range. Once the user enters the correct value of C, use the formula in the above question to get a value of F. Display F to 2 decimal places.
5. Get a value of N in the range [0,7]. Calculate the factorial (N!) of this number.
6. Write a program that uses nested loops to print the following pattern
*******
******
*****
****
***
**
*
7. Write a program that get a series of positive numbers from the user. The user can enter a negative number to signal the end of the series. After this, all the positive numbers that are entered by the user should be added and their sum should be displayed.

PROJECT 4:

1. A function that calculates sin(x), cos(x) and tan(x) for a input x in degrees and returns to the main program.
2. A Write a function that finds the maximum and minimum of three numbers and returns to the main program.
3. The area of a rectangle is calculated according to the following formula: Area = Width × Length
4. A program that does the following to calculate the roots of the equation ax^2+bx+c=0   (1) The main program gets the values of a, b and c from the user. (2) The function rootCheck calculates the value of   and reports if the roots exist and if so whether they are unique or multiple. (3) If the roots exist the function rootTerms calculates the roots and the main program displays them to the user.
5. A program that gets two sets of coordinates (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) from the user. The first set of coordinates must lie in the 2nd or 3rd quadrant. The 2nd set of coordinates must lie in the 1st or 4th quadrant. The program seeks the inputs until these criteria are met. It then calculates the distance and the angle between the two points.
6. A program which accepts a users gender, age and hourly wage. Continuously takes input until "0" is entered
7. Calculates the displacement of a particle

PROJECT 5:

1. Puts 10 random numbers into a file "Example_File_1". Displays the sum and the average of them.
2. Multiplies all the numbers in "Example_File_1" by 3 and puts them in a file "Example_File_2".
3. Gets a year and class average from the user and puts them into a file "Example_File_3".
4. Looks through "Example_File_1" and if a number is less than 5, the program replaces it with 100. Puts results into "Example_File_4".
5. Gets angles between 0 and 180, puts them as well as their sin, cos and tan into a file "Example_File_5"

PROJECT 6:

1. Gets sales information for the quarter from the user. Prints the data, total sales and commission for the salesperson.
2. Scrapped function, ignore.
3. Creates a list of 25 numbers. user enters a value. Program doubles every value from the 
list that is less than X. Finds and prints the average of the old and new list.
4. Creates a list of answers given by a student and a list of solutions. There are 25 "answers" and "solutions" each of which are
 a randomized assortment of "A", "B", "C", and "D". The program compares the 2 lists. More than 17 is a pass, less is a fail. Program prints the result and final score.
5. Gets a value from the user. The program finds all prime numbers less than the number provided and prints the final list of what it found.
6. Creates an matrix containing all angles (in steps of 10) between 0 and 180 as well as their sin, cos and tan. Any sin value 
greater than 0.4 has a graph plotted for the sin, cos and tan.

PROJECT 7:

1. Takes the last name of a student. If the first character of the name is before "f", the program states that they take the test in room 1, otherwise in room 2.
2. Reads a list of example "names" from a file "data.txt". If the first letter of the first name is before "f", student is in room 1, otherwise room 2. 
If the name begins with a number, displays the room as "--" since it is invalid.

PROJECT 8:

1. Gets an "m" value and "V" value from the user. Calculates a "K" value based on k=0.5*m*(v^2)
2. Creates a quiz based on two multiplication tables of numbers provided by the user. There are 5 random questions in total.
Tells the user whether they passed or failed and their score.

PROJECT 9:

1. Creates a "Pet" object consisting of the name, type and age based on user input.
2. Creates a random set of mass, height and velocity. Creates an object based on o.5*m*(v^2) and an obect based on m*g*h where "g" is the gravity constant.
The program compares the two objects and determines which one is greater. Results are printed.
3. A "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game.
